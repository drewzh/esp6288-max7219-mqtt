# What is this?

An MQTT-powered scrolling LED board firmware written in C++ for ESP8266. Compiles with PlatformIO/Arduino (I use PlatformIO) and flashes to very low-cost ESP8266 boards to make a very low-cost (around Â£14) retro scrolling LED marquee that's network controllable (super useful for things like Home Assistant notifications).

# How much effort to build the entire thing?

You can always attach the board + display together via jumper cable, but a more permanent approach would be to solder them. I'd say, even with soldering, this shouldn't take any more than 30 minutes to complete (assuming you've pre-printed the case).
